**There are four types of data types in java**
* int (positive,zero,negative no.s)
* Boolean( true/false)
* Double ( decimals,big numbers)
* char ('A')

**String is a object**

**Static checking**
Performs checking at compile time

**Operators**
+, -, * , /, % ,==, != ,>= ,<= ,> ,<
* For string we have .equals method
` (a.equals(b)); `
* String concatination: +

**Oop helps create custom datatypes**

* Class is blueprint
**Object is instance of class**

**Constructor method**
* Creates instance of class
* Constructor method is for creating objects(name same as class)
`Car ferrari = new Car();`

* **`System` is predefined class used to loging text to our source**
* **`main()` which lists the tasks to be performed by program**
* **A program doesnt compile without main()**
 ### Objects
When we print object , we get address of location of instance.
* Instance field is state of object
* We will assign values in method through object and then assign these to instance field
### **Methods**
Mostly used for not repeting code and performing some function.
