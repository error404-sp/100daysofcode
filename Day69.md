<details><summary>Started learning javascript from freecodecamp, learnt till Concatination with the plus equals operator.</summary>

**Javascript is a high level programmiing language**
### Comments
`//` or `/* ... */`
### Variables
* undefined 
* null
* boolean
* string
* symbol
* bigint
* number
* object
**We use `var` keyword for declaring variables
### Storing values with assignment operator
Assignment always goes from right to left
`myVar=5;`
### Initializing varables with assignment operator
### Understanding uninitialised variables
* When javascript variables are declared, they have initial value of `undefined`.
* If mathematical operation is performed on `undefined` , result will be `NaN`
* If a string is concatinated with `undefined` variable, the string will be `undefined`
### Understanding Case sensitivity in variable
came case is followed.
### Operator
+= , -=, **=,/= 
### Escaping literal quotes in strings
In Javascript, you can escape a quote from considering as an end of string by placing backslash`\`
`var samplwStr="Alan said, \"Peter is learning Javascript\"."; `
### Quoting strings with single quotes
We can add single and double quotes to avoid backslash
### Escape sequences in strings
**There are two reason to use escaping characters**
* To allow you to use character, you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as carriage return
* To allow you to represent multiple quotes in string without javascript misinterpreting what you mean.
| Code |      Output     |
|:----:|:---------------:|
|  \'  |  single quotes  |
|  \"  |  double quotes  |
|  \\  |    backslash    |
| \n   | newline         |
| \r   | carriage return |
| \t   | tab             |
| \b   | word boundary   |
| \f   | form feed       |

### Basic concatination with + operator
