Solved hackerank problmes

1.
Welcome to the world of Java! In this challenge, we practice printing to stdout.

The code stubs in your editor declare a Solution class and a main method. Complete the main method by copying the two lines of code below and pasting them inside the body of your main method.

System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");

Input Format

There is no input for this challenge.

Output Format

You must print two lines of output:

    Print Hello, World. on the first line.
    Print Hello, Java. on the second line.

Sample Output

Hello, World.
Hello, Java.
Answer:
public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello, World.") ;
       System.out.println("Hello, Java.");/* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
    }
}

Most HackerRank challenges require you to read input from stdin (standard input) and write output to stdout (standard output).

One popular way to read input from stdin is by using the Scanner class and specifying the Input Stream as System.in. For example:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String myString = scanner.next();
int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
scanner.close();

System.out.println("myString is: " + myString);
System.out.println("myInt is: " + myInt);

The code above creates a Scanner object named

and uses it to read a String and an int. It then closes the Scanner object because there is no more input to read, and prints to stdout using System.out.println(String). So, if our input is:

Hi 5

Our code will print:

myString is: Hi
myInt is: 5

Alternatively, you can use the BufferedReader class.

Task
In this challenge, you must read

integers from stdin and then print them to stdout. Each integer must be printed on a new line. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor below.

Input Format

There are

lines of input, and each line contains a single integer.

Sample Input

42
100
125

Sample Output

42
100
125

Answer
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = scan.nextInt();

        // Complete this line
        // Complete this line

        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
        // Complete this line
        // Complete this line
    }
}

Q3 
In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

Task
Given an integer,

, perform the following conditional actions:

    If 

is odd, print Weird
If
is even and in the inclusive range of to
, print Not Weird
If
is even and in the inclusive range of to
, print Weird
If
is even and greater than

    , print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not

is weird.

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer,

.

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3

Sample Output 0

Weird

Sample Input 1

24

Sample Output 1

Not Weird

Explanation

Sample Case 0:

is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1:

and is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
